# teensy-nrf24 #

A nrf24 library for AVR, not arduino.  I'm currently testing this
on teensy 2.0 (ATmega32U4) and teensy++ 2.0 (AT90USB1286).
In the future, I'll probably port this to ATmega88/168 (since I
have a bunch laying around) and ATtiny88 for super-cheap sensors.

This isn't very generalized -- it's mostly for my needs and
on the boards I have.  Maybe it works for you, maybe it doesn't.
PRs welcome.
